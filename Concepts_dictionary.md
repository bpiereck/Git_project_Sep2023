# Most Important Concepts

1. James needs to "git" good at git ;) 

# My 1st Git projet

- Git repository: Is single collection of documents where you want to track modificiations. Offline.

- GitHub: Colections of different repositories wich you want version control. Online.

## Conceptual Areas

1. Dev. Area: Folder where I dev. my project. - It is in your computer - locally

2. Staging Area: Intermediate space to trasfer from the dev. area to your local repo. - locally in your coputer.
   
   - **Why is the Staging are interesting**: If several files are connected to check the correlated changes you can stage at the same time and commit them together. 

3. Local repository:  The repository where you keep your snapshots. It is found inthe `.git` folder. In my computer - locally

P.s.: To check in what conceptual area my files are I can use `git status`.



4. Remote repository: Online repository  - works as a back up of your local repository. This is most probably a cloud-like kind of repository. In this case it is represented by GitHub. 



Testing what happens if I dont use -m to commit:

It pops up an editor to force me to write a msg, with the optioin of making a long description instead of just a title.
